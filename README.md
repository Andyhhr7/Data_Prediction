# Data_Prediction
Through raw data, the simulation predicts large data for a company

# Data Introduction
The file will be a comma-separated file (csv) that contains n observations of p explanatory variables (labeled X1–Xp) and one response (Y). That’s all I’m telling you about the data.
My job is to develop a method for predicting Y based on X. You may use any of the techniques covered in class.

# Models used in the project
Random Forest, Boosting, Neural Net, LASSO/min, LASSO/1SE

# In the end
The value of MSE was calculated and recorded for each model and finally the gap between MSPE and MSE was calculated. Prevents overfitting of the model and ensures that the model performs well in predicting new data.
